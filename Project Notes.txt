### Implementation notes

This solution implements the minimax adversarial search algorithm to produce
intelligent responses to Tic-Tac-Toe moves. Given a game state, it explores the
decision tree looking for optimal moves (that is, branches that lead to a win or
at least a tie).

Furthermore I implemented alpha-beta pruning, which is a search optimization that
allows some branches of the decision tree to be left unexplored if it becomes
clear that a better choice has already been found. For more information see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax.
